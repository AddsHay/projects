Do we want rooms to be able to be built off rooms?

Function that chooses random wall tile on each structure 

using that random tile as the position, we call a random one of our three build functions 
from that spot.

how to deal with conflicts:
if a new build would overlap an existing build, cancel it and do another random call
 

Do a random number of those build calls in a certain range

If you have x failed build calls in a row, end early
